# FoodWise
Designed and developed a foodwise website using Vite.js, .Net 6, and SQL Server database. 
The website provides a platform for users to search for recipes based on ingredients, making it easier to plan and prepare meals.
Utilized Vite.js, a modern JavaScript framework, to create a fast and responsive user interface, providing a smooth browsing experience.
Implemented .Net 6, a powerful framework for building web applications, to manage and store data and provide dynamic content.
Integrated SQL Server, a popular relational database management system, to store and retrieve recipe information, ensuring the accuracy and reliability of the data.
Developed a search function that allows users to easily find recipes based on ingredients, providing relevant and accurate results.
Improved my knowledge of web development and gained experience in integrating frontend and backend technologies, including Vite.js, .Net 6, and SQL Server.
Contributed to the website's functionality and usability, including adding features, fixing bugs, and optimizing performance.
